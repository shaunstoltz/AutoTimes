# AutoTimes (Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting)

The repo is the official implementation for the paper: [AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370). It currently includes code implementations for the following tasks:

> **[Time Series Forecasting](./scripts/time_series_forecasting/)**: AutoTimes repurpose large language models as autoregressive multivariate time series forecasters, which frees from training respectively on lookback lengths and allows arbitrary-length predictions with alleviated error accumulation

> **[Zero-shot Forecasting](./scripts/zero_shot_forecasting/)**: Large Models exhibiting remarkable zero-shot capability. AutoTimes takes advantage of LLM's general-purposed token transition as the future extrapolation of time series, demonstrating good performance without downstream samples.

> **[In-context Forecasting](./scripts/in_context_forecasting/)**: We propose in-context forecasting for the first time to extend the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, where time series prompts can further incorporated into the context to enhance forecasting.

> **[Generality and Scability of LLM](scripts/method_generality)**: AutoTimes is compatiable with any decoder-only large language models, demonstrating generality and proper scaling behavior.

## Introduction

üåü While prevalent LLM4TS methods adapt decoder-only and autoregressive
LLMs as encoder-only and non-autoregressive forecasters, we propose to **keep consistent with the inherent autoregressive property and model architecture**.

</p>

üí™ We aim to **fully revitalize the capabilities of LLMs as foundation models for time series forecasting**, including iterative multi-step forecasting, zero-shot capability, **in-context forecasting**, and multimodal utilization.

üèÜ AutoTimes achieves **state-of-the-art performance** with **0.1% trainable parameters and over 5√ó training/inference speedup** compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.

## Overall Approach

* Time series and corresponding timestamps are segmented.
* Textual timestamps are converted into the position embedding of segments.
* AutoTimes learns to embed time series segments by next token prediction, where intermediate layers of LLM are frozen.

## Usage 

1. Install Pytorch and necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Put the datasets [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t7jOkctNJ0rt3VMwZaqmxSuA75TFEo96/view?usp=sharing)
[[Tsinghua Cloud]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/849427d3926f4fabbee7/) under the folder ```./dataset/```.

2. Download the large language models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and specify the model path using the `llm_ckp_dir` parameter in scripts.
   * [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2)
   * [OPT Family](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-125m)
   * [LLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b)

3. Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ```./scripts/```.

```
# the default large language model is LLaMA-7B

# long-term forecasting
bash ./scripts/time_series_forecasting/long_term/AutoTimes_ETTh1.sh

# short-term forecasting
bash ./scripts/time_series_forecasting/short_term/AutoTimes_M4.sh

# zero-shot forecasting
# it's worth noting that sM4_tM3 utilizes models trained
# on short-term, you should run AutoTimes_M4 first
bash ./scripts/zero_shot_forecasting/sM4_tM3.sh
bash ./scripts/zero_shot_forecasting/sM3_tM4.sh

# in-context forecasting
bash ./scripts/in_context_forecasting/M3.sh

# other large language models
bash ./scripts/method_generality/opt.sh

# preprocess timestamps to generate text embedding
python ./preprocess.py --gpu 0 --dataset ETTh1
```

> Due to the simple tokenization and the frozen of LLM blocks, AutoTimes is highly applicable compared with other LLM4TS methods. For example, it requires only **15min** for AutoTime to repurpuse LLaMA-7B on ETTh1 on one single RTX 3090-24G.

|            | Non-autoregressive                                           | Autoregressive                                               |
| -------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Training             | Trained with specific lookback-forecast lengths              | Trained with the context length with **each generated token being supervised** |
| One-step Forecasting | Applicable only on fixed lookback-forecast lengths           | Flexible on scenarios **less than the context length** like large language models |
| Rolling Forecasting  | Has to drop the lookback series because of the fixed input length | **Can prolong the lookback horizon** until the total length exceeds the context length |

## Time Series Forecasting

Towards the vertility of foundation models, we establish a novel **one-for-all** benchmark: a single forecaster is trained on one dataset and subsequently utilized for all prediction lengths, where we achieve SOTA results in **80%** datasets. In the conventional **one-for-one** scenario, AutoTimes still achieved state-of-the-art performance in **70%** of settings without respective training.

</p>

## Zero-shot Forecasting

We evaluate the performance under the transfer learning scenario, where the forecaster is first trained on a source domain and then directly evaluated on the unseen target domain.

</p>

## In-context Forecasting

Benefiting from the time series prompts from the target domain, our LLM-based forecaster with the proposed in-context forecasting paradigm achieves consistent promotions on all M3 subsets and the averaged **13.3%** SMAPE reduction compared with zero-shot forecasting.

</p>

## Model Generality

We evaluate the generality and model efficiency on alternative LLMs, demonstrating improved performance with the increase of parameters that **validates the scaling law**.

</p>


## Method Efficency

Not only does AutoTime achieve more acurate predcitions but its training and reasoning time is also greatly reduced, bringing over 5√ó speedup on average.

## Textual Timestamps as Position Embedding

We conduct ablations our position embedding of textual timestamps. The performance is consistently promoted because of better positional alignment of multivariate time series segments.

</p>

## Flexible Input Length

In the conventional forecasting paradigm, deep forecasters are trained respectively, limiting their applicability to a single lookback length. In contrast, our forecasters have the versatility to handle various input lengths with one model.

</p>

## Low-rank Adaption

By further incorporating [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), the token transition of LLMs can be better aligned to the time series modality with improved performance.
